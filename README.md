# Machine Learning Teaching
Notebooks serve as a complement to lecture (where motivations and details behing the algorithms are shown in detail).

Introduction to machine learning for an undergraduate physics audience with knowledge of python and basic computations.
Notebooks make use of the following Python packages: pandas, sci-kit learn, matplotlib, seaborn, numpy.

Intuitive presentation/development of the ideas behind:
1) Regression
2) Classification (logistic regression, decision trees)
3) Clustering (PCA, LDA)

Ideas are then applied to the Iris dataset to compare the various methods as well perform the simple classification.
